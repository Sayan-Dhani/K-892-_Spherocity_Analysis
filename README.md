**Timeline : April 2023 - Present**

Description : 
- Implemented spherocity dependence on K*(892) analysis from ALICE O2- Physics framework.
- Reconstructed K892 from its decay channel to pion and Kion.
- Analysed the yield of K*(892) in deferent transverse momentum(PT) and spherocity($S_0$) ranges.

Work update stage :
- Run on Local files & Presented the results in ALICE Physics Analysis Group of Light Falvor Resonances (PAHLF-Resonances)
- Currently, we are running the code on Hyperloop for larger statistics.
